# My Web Development Project

## Overview
This project is an experiment to create a personal website using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. It consists of three distinct web pages, each designed to demonstrate various web development techniques.

## Pages

### Tim Berners-Lee Information Page (`index.html`)
This page is dedicated to Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web. It provides an overview of his contributions to the development of the internet and the HTML language. The page is styled using Bootstrap for a responsive and modern design.

### Learning Journey Page (`learning_journey.html`)
This page outlines my learning journey in web development. It includes tables that display the number of days I spent practicing different technologies such as HTML, Bootstrap, and jQuery. The page is interactive, with Bootstrap tooltips providing additional information about each section.

### jQuery Experimentation Page (`jquery_experiment.html`)
The third page is an interactive experiment that demonstrates various jQuery functionalities. Users can interact with different form elements like text inputs, radio buttons, checkboxes, file uploads, and more. The background and content change dynamically based on user interactions, showcasing jQueryâ€™s capability to manipulate the DOM.

## Technologies Used

## Setup and Usage
1. **Clone or Download the Repository:** Obtain the project files from the repository.
2. **Open the HTML Files:** Open each HTML file in your preferred web browser to view the content.
3. **Interact with jQuery Features:** To experiment with the jQuery features, interact with the form elements on the `jquery_experiment.html` page.
