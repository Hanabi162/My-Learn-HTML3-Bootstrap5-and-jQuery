### Overview
- This project is an experiment to create my website using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. It consists of three web pages: the first page provides information about Tim Berners-Lee, the founder of the World Wide Web and HTML; the second page details my learning journey; and the final page is an experiment with jQuery.
